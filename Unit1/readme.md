# Executive summary
What is an Information System? This week we are discussing Information Systems. There are 5 components that make up an Information System, and one important component. Communications is not a main component because it is not required. Basically, the 5 main components of Information Technology are Hardware, Software, Data, People, and Processes. They are explained there:

1. Hardware requires space. Hard drive, screen, keyboard, and mouse sizes are called hardware. Innovations can decrease physical size to allow more hardware within a case. Hardware can also break down and requires tune-ups. Temperature sensitive hardware is materially manufactured.  Hardware is required to be made from resilient materials due to dropping, temperature changes, circuit malfunctions, and fiber optic signals. Hardware cannot be changed without removing and adding parts to a machine.

2. Software, on the other hand, is typed and saved as codes or scripts. Buggy code and scripts can be impossible to execute so software is intangible. Even if software is written into hardware, such as CD and DVD-roms, software can be re-written. Software requires computers, or other hardware, to be created. Software possibilities seem to vary infinitely. I would like to challenge this question of infinite software capabilities. Software is like spoken language and communicates. Software is illustrated as programs, games, formats, fonts, numbers, colors, sounds, actions, commands, and more.

3. Data is visually stimulating yet intangible within a database. Data is derived from observed actions and can become interpretations that derive conclusions with supporting evidence. Think of any occurrence and its frequency, this is data.

4. People are professionals, providers and consumers who build, buy, and sell hardware, code, software, data, teams, processes, information systems, cyber security, and more. They socialize about Information Technology.

5. Processes instruct people and are complete steps for information systems to progress. With processes, team are likely to achieve goals and report rational progressions. Charles Babbage completed a process after his death. Processes can be bought and sold. 

6. Not yet a main component, communications, the socialization, shared processing between multiple hardware is very important and should be included to our education. I think if communication devices could be custom built, users will find them personal, making communication technologies recognized as a major component of information systems.

# Information System Components  

Automatic Teller Machines are autonomous money dispensers open 24 hours per day and night. Shortly known as ATMs, ATMs distribute fair amounts of cash for customers and should verify account holder bank cards, account balances, credit limits and print account statements and account balances and transaction summaries. I will summarize a non-bank ATM process there:

ATM process: hardware cameras record people and software transmit data for security personnel people. Hardware reads cards, then data software transmits it to verify specific customer account software. Keypad hardware verifies customer people, screen hardware displays account prompt software and information software such as ‘no receipt’ and ‘withdraw amount’ data. Keystroke software prompts hardware to collect and dispense cash. Some ATMs do not receive checks, they have components for that. Software adds and subtracts data, then communications transmit bank balances each day. The Federal Reserve Banks receive transmitted daily bank balances. Federal Reserve Banks transmit data to The FED. The FED data influences bond, stock, and international exchange rate values.

# GitHub

* We are communicating using a forum. You log in with your credentials. I log in with my credentials. Client-server architecture runs both you and me into one forum. Client-server architecture is software that supports communication. When Professor Manjula accesses the client-server of GitHub, she can see files I uploaded. If Professor Manjula asked, I would let her share my GitHub uploads, but instead GitHub's client-server so she only needs to ask once then I can share all my files with her permission saved. Sharing requires a server. In GitHub you are experiencing a "Client-Server" architecture because content you did not add, can be accessed by you.

Cloud computing cuts out our hardware. Those providers of cloud computing use their own hardware hard drives for customers to use less of their own hard drive. For a fee, we can use more hard drive space. Gmail (email) and Google Doc (spreadsheet, presentation, documentation) servers are available online 24/7 and effective. Cloud computing servers display saved files for authorized devices and accounts.

I use cloud computing to be successful in groups. Project writing needs group member updates any time, so I use Google Docs until it is finished. Google Docs are cloud based and Google's servers save Excel, PowerPoint, and Word data and assign a sharable link for anyone to view or edit them. Without cloud computing will we be able to send email?

# Conclusion

10:52PM June 11, 2020 
My economical vision lacks programming experience. GitHub is a repository client server for programming text. I want to learn more about GitHub and its commercial uses, how to make money with GitHub, and new topics like application software, communication network/software integration, and application business expenses. 

Because my commit was blocked, to complete Lab #1, my GitHub account required push access. I learned how technologist support each other. I sent snipped images of my errors. Professor Manjula fixed the push access error, then emailed me asking for current errors. Because there were none, my repository could commit with Professor Manjula's repository and I can finish my assignment.

In this section you might discuss future considerations (what you might want to learn more about), issues that you encountered (remember you may decide to post your repo link on LinkedIn or provide to a future employer so be sure to keep your discussion professional) and/or your impressions of the lab components.
